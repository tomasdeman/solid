The following five concepts make up our SOLID principles:
* **Single Responsibility** - a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
* **Open/Closed** - classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
* **Liskov Substitution** -  if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.
* **Interface Segregation** - larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones
* **Dependency Inversion** - This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
